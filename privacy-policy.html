	<h2>1. General</h2>
	<p>By uploading an image or enabling location data in the Xplore application you guarantee that you have read this Privacy Policy of the Xplore application and that you agree to abide by all clauses within its Terms and Conditions. You also understand and agree that nothing in this agreement obligates Xplore to display or use your images or location data.</p>
	<h2>2. Your privacy</h2>
	<p>The Xplore application will never misuse the camera or location functionality to intrude on your privacy. Xplore will never use either functionality without your consent. Consent can be granted by agreeing to the permission prompts in the application on devices running Android Marshmallow or above, or on lower versions of Android - during the installation of the Xplore application. Xplore reserves the right to never ask for consent to use location permission from your phone after you have consented to it once. However, the location functionality is only enabled when you proceed to the part of the Xplore application, which requires your location. Such pages will always ask for respective permissions if you have not consented to them.</p>
	<h2>3. Collection of information</h2>
	<p>The Xplore applcation implicitly collects location data when viewing your live hikes or the map. This only happens after you've consented to let Xplore use your location and proceeded to the parts of the application which require location updates to function. Location can be turned off at any time. No other data is collected by the Xplore application implicitly. Everything else is explicitly entered and provided by the user to the Xplore application. Xplore reserves the right to use all data which is explicitly obtained in any way.</p>
	<h2>4. Updating the Privacy Policy</h2>
	<p>Xplore reserves the right in its sole and absolute discretion to alter the privacy policy only to improve it by correcting errors or updating parts of the privacy policy to suit newer versions of the Xplore application. Xplore also reserves the right to make changes without prior notice. You are responsible for keeping yourself updated on any such changes herein that might affect you.
