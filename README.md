# xplore.ge

The old landing page for Xplore, an android app for planning and finding hikes.

Should be available at https://xploreapp.github.io

This website was strung together in a hurry by my teammate. Then I made it worse. No meaningful changes will be made for historical reasons.

If you wish to see the newer version, which sadly didn't get to see the light of day before Xplore shut down, go to https://xplore-landing.netlify.com

Why did Xplore shut down? You can read my blog post to find out: [Learning from your failed startup](https://nikaoto.com/blog/learning-from-your-failed-startup/)
